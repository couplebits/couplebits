### Hey y'all
Thanks for dropping by. I work at Veeam as a Solutions Architect on the Product Management Alliances team. Before this role, I was a senior engineer on Veeam's public cloud team supporting their cloud-native products for AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud.

If you're interested in learning about Veeam Backup for AWS in particular, check out the veeam-aws-lab repo. I wrote several templates and scripts for internal training sessions that I led within Veeam, and I've shared them here to make it easy for others to deploy and destroy an environment for testing purposes. Check it out - there are multiple branches for the different sessions I hosted.

More to come here on other projects I'm working on.
