### Hey Y'all
Thanks for dropping by. I work at Veeam on the Product Management Alliances team. Before this role, I was a senior engineer on Veeam's public cloud team where I worked in AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud to support their cloud-native products for those platforms.

If you're interested in learning about Veeam Backup for AWS in particular, check out the veeam-aws-lab repo. I wrote some templates and scripts for internal training sessions that I led within Veeam, and I've shared them here to make it easy for others to deploy and destroy an environment for testing purposes. Check it out.

More to come here on other projects I'm working on.
